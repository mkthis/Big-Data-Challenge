# Big-Data-Challenge

In this challenge, Amazon review data from their paid program (Vine) and unpaid reviews were processed via Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) into a PostgreSQL database, using Amazon Web Services to handle and pass the volume of data into our database. 

Two categories of reviews were chosen and read in to the notebook. The data was then cleaned, or transformed, based on the schema table setups given in the SQL document. 

Once the tables were cleaned and transformed, the data was written into a PostgreSQL database using Amazon Web Services RDS. At this stage, further analysis can be conducted according to the questions of the investigators.
